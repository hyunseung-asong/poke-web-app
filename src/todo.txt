TODO: 

pokedex:
 DONE - use react query? 
 DONE - get api calls reactquery and it auto caches
 DONE - display the pokemon's data
 DONE - need 3 states, loading, success, error
 
 DONE install and use bootstrap to make css look good
 - eventually convert bootstrap to tailwind css for more flexibility and larger scale development

 
 HAVE TO UPDATE WITH MORE INFO ON PAGE loading screen while api call for all pokemon information


 - select generation to display pokemon sprites and types

 - display the pokemon type with colored boxes
 - use pokeapi.co/api/v2/type/1/  1 through 19 from normal to stellar(gen 9 scarlet violet)



 - <b> Think about setting up PokeAPI database to call locally instead
 - or use github.com/PokeAPI/sprites for images


 - setup unit tests?
using phaser.io for a game (tetris or other)
